Description:
	gGraph class represents each DNA segment (a sub string of the reference genome)
	as a length 2 GRanges (separating positive strand and its reverse complement),
	and each adjacency between ranges an edge (single phosphodiester bond
	connecting nucleotides) in a directed graph. Edges and nodes are associated with
	positive integer field "cn" standing for their absolute copy number per cell.
	Three types of edges are permitted: reference, the adjacencies consistent with the
	reference genome; aberrant, the adjacencies not present in the reference genome; and
	loose, a place holder for putative breakpoints inferred from copy number profile but
	missing from structural variation callers. bGraph class holds constrained gGraph
	where the sum of copy numbers of all incoming edges, equals the sum of copy numbers
	of all outgoing edges, equals the copy number of the node for every node in the
	graph except terminal nodes.
