fusions(gg = NULL, junc = NULL, cds = NULL, promoters = NULL,
  query = NULL, prom.window = 1000, max.chunk = 1e+10,

}
\arguments{
\item{gg}{a gGraph object (for example from JaBbA; overrides junctions input)}

\item{junc}{GRangesList of junctions (each a length 2 GRanges)}

\item{cds}{CDS annotations (GrangesList of transcript composed of coordinates coding regions of exons)}

\item{promoters}{GRanges of promoters (same length as transcript)}

\item{query}{optional query limiting walks to specific regions of interest}

\item{prom.window}{window to use around each transcript to identify putative promoter if promoter is NULL}
}
\value{
GRangesList of walks corresponding to transcript boundaires
}
\description{
annotates all gene fusions given an n x n adjacency matrix A of n genomic segments seg and grl of transcripts (eg output of read_RefGene)
seg must be (1) a tiling of the genome and (2) have copies of both + and - intervals for each genomic range (eg output of karyograph)
}
\details{
alternate input is a pile of junctions of ranges with strand orientation pointing AWAY from breakend

cds = gencode cds GRanges gff3 / gtf input

"gene_name" GRangesList meta data field is used in annotation and in not creating "splice" fusions that arise from different transcripts of the same gene.
